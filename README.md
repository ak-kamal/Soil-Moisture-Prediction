# Soil-Moisture-Prediction
An ML pipeline for soil irrigation systems that preprocesses sensor data (temperature, humidity, and motor state), visualizes patterns, and applies multiple regressors including an MLP neural network. Models are compared to identify the most accurate predictor of soil moisture.
